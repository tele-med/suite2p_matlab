To install the package and use it as a GUI you need to download just the CalciumApp053022 folder. Then go in the folder containing the for_redistribution_files_only 
in its name and click on the .exe file.

To use the code from Matlab, download the Source folder, set the matlab path to the just downloaded folder and type CalciumApp in the command window.
