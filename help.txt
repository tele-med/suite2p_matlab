*****************************Main Window***********************************
**************************************************************************
In the main window you can choose between 4 different options:

1) Black Frame Elimination Toolbox (pre suite2p)
Choose this option if you want to pre-process/visualize your data before opening them 
with suite2p. 
This toolbox allows you to:
- get rid off the black frames in you tif stack video 
- analize the ROI dimension to obtain the spatial_scale parameter for suite2p
- visualize the tif movie


2) Drug Application Experiment (post suite2p)
Choose this option if you are working with a tif movie obtained during an experiment
where the cells had been stimulated with a drug.

3) Swing Cells Experiment (post suite2p)
Choose this option if you are working with a tif movie obtained during an experiment
in which the cells had not been stimulated.

4) Optogenetic Experiment (post suite2p)
Choose this option if you are working with a tif movie obtained during an optogenetic 
experiment



**********************Black Frame Elimination Toolbox**********************
*******************************************************************
This is the frame in which you are able to pre-process and visualize a tif 
movie before the suite2p pipeline.


***Menu bar:

1)ROI Manager= Allows to choose a tif file, draw manually some ROI on it and 
estimate an average diameter for them.
--->Choose tif=Opens a file browser in order to choose the tif file you want
               to analize
--->Analyze=   After a click on this menu item two windows will pop-up.
               -The biggest window contains a frame of the tif stack.
               -The smaller window is an ROI manager that allows you to:
                1.draw a new ROI on the currently visualized image
                2.measure the average diameter of the choosen ROIs and obtain
                  the spatial_scale parameter (suite2p).
                3.choose between 3 different frames of the movie: 
                   image_1=frame taken at 1/5 of the movie length 
                   image_2=frame taken at 2/5 of the movie length 
                   image_3=frame taken at 3/5 of the movie length
                4.delete all the current ROI selection and start with a new one

2)Visualize= Allows to choose a file and opens the movie visualizer.


***Text Area
The left white vertical panel is a text area, in which you can find usefull informations
like the files contained in the directory you choosed to open, or the name of the file you
are working with, or a "wait" if some processes are running.

***Configuration
This panel on the right is dedicated to the black frame elimination process.
-First of all use one of the 2 import buttons Import File/Import Directory to choose a tif file
or a directory (in which a group of tif files is stored)and apply the black frame elimination
function to it(them).
-You can eventually set the name of the destination folder you want to save the tif movies without the black
frames. If you don't specify the name, then a folder called noBlack will be automatically 
created in your actual path.
-You can also specify the grey level considered as black. Set it to a value<1000 if some of
the black frames are still included in the movie after the processing. Otherwise leave the default
value of 1000.
